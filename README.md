# Turbot Docker Runner

## Quickstart

```
bin/turbot help
```

That will build the Turbot image and run `turbot help` inside it.

Now you use the `bin/docker-run` script to run commands in the context of the Ruby interpreter and gems that work with the Turbot project, and `bin/turbot` script instead of the `turbot` command.
